# Mafia
## What is this app?
Mafia (also known as Werewolf), is a social deduction game where everyone has a role to play, whether they are on the side of the Mafia, the Town, or simply their own will.

This project is a (work-in-progress) implementation of the game for a physically present group.

## How do I run it?
Either use the production build (`npm run build`) or the development server (`npm start`) to open the webpage where you can play the game.

## Future features
After I actually get the cursed game logic to work I'll add online multiplayer as well :)
